//Question 5 :TOWER OF HANOI(Important!)
//You have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide on to any tower.
// The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom
// (i.e.,each disks its on top of an even larger one).You have the following constraints:
// (1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
// (2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower.
// (3)A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. Write a program to move the disks from 
// the first tower to thelast using Stacks.Let rod 1 = 'A', rod 2 = 'B', rod 3 = 'C'.An example 
// with 2 disks i.e. N=2:Step 1 : Shift the first disk from 'A' to 'B'.
// Step 2 : Shift the second disk from 'A' to 'C'.
// Step 3 : Shift the first disk from 'B' to 'C'
